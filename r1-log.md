***Today's Progress:*** Started working on a responsive webpage. Today I worked on the homepage and login and signup page.

### R3D3: 
***Today's Progress:*** Added footer with social icon buttons. Also worked on a static login/signup page with html and plane css.

***Thoughts:*** I was too distracted to work on the static page and spent a lot of time on it. Finally got the look I wanted.
